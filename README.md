Sudoku Solver - Work in Progress

The sudoku solver can solve a jig-saw puzzle and can be extended for other types of sudoku puzzles. The solver is written in python in order to learn python and program a simple user interface.
The project is organized in folders:
* basesudoku holds the base classes to handle a sudoku and cells,
* jigsaw extends basesudoku with jigsaw puzzle behaviour and rule based solving,
* hyper is empty and is the start of another sudoku puzzle type,
* root holds main that initializes a sudoku window and set a jigsaw puzzle for solving,
* Test holds the unit test classes performed by python unittest lib.

The jigsaw solving rules are implemented in jigsawSudoku.py.
