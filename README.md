*Sudoku Solver - Work in Progress*

The sudoku solver solves a jig-saw puzzle using rules. The solver can be extended for other types of sudoku puzzles. The solver is written in python in order to learn python and program a simple user interface. And, it uses rule based solving, so it's a kind of artificial intelligence.
The project is organized in folders:
* basesudoku holds the base classes to handle a sudoku and cells,
* jigsaw extends basesudoku with jigsaw puzzle behaviour and rules for solving jigsaw puzzles,
* hyper is empty and is the start of another sudoku puzzle type,
* root holds main that initializes a sudoku window and set a jigsaw puzzle for solving,
* Test holds the unit test classes performed by python unittest lib.

The jigsaw solving rules are implemented in jigsawSudoku.py.
